# FindFriends

Coding_Challenge.java file is the main code file.
This task is to count the size of the social network of the word LISTY in the dictionary provided.
We define two words as being friends if the edit distance between them is 1. For this problem, we will be using Levenshtein distance (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) as our edit distance.

Since there are repetitive words in the dictionary.txt file.

Problems:(pay attention)
If we do not count the repetitive word as friend, then we can use Hashset instead of ArrayList.
